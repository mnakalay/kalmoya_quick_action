# kalmoya Quick Action
Delete blocks faster in Concrete5 v8 without confirmation.

This package adds a "Quick Delete" item to blocks contextual menu in Concrete5 v8. It allows you to delete blocks faster by skipping the confirmation.

**Be careful: once it's deleted, it's deleted!**

The package might be developed later on to add more shortcuts, hence the hesitation between Quick Action and Quick Delete for the name :)

Feel totally free to make suggestions for useful shortcuts.
