# kalmoya Quick Actions

This package adds a few things to the blocks' contextual edit menu

- Delete blocks faster in Concrete5 v8 without confirmation (**Be careful: once it's deleted, it's deleted!**)
- Create a preset from a block's custom design styles
- Apply a saved preset to other blocks

As I get (or am given) more ideas for shortcuts and helpers, they will be added to the package.

Feel totally free to make suggestions for useful shortcuts.
